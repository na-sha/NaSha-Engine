# NaSha-Engine (Vulkan)
This is a vulkan based engine in progress... <br><br>
**Problem(for now):** You have to compile the shaders into bytecode at Nasha/src/Nasha  because I can't find a way to automate it in CMakeList.txt<br><br>
**Just** clone the project and **run:**
```
mkdir build-dir
cd build-dir
cmake ..
make
```
